This notebook explores the application of the Markov Cluster Algorithm (MCL), a method for graph clustering commonly used in bioinformatics, network analysis, and data segmentation. The content demonstrates algorithm implementation, key steps, and results, providing insights into how MCL partitions networks into clusters. It includes code snippets, outputs, and visualization to guide the understanding of clustering dynamics.
