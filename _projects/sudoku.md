Welcome to the Sudoku Solver project! Ever stared at a Sudoku grid and felt your neurons overheating? This program tackles that for you using the magical-sounding AC-3 {% cite mackworth1977consistency %} constraint satisfaction algorithm. Choose from three different Sudoku setups—if you find yourself stumped, just hit "solve" and let logic (and a little code) do the heavy lifting. Bragging rights for human vs. machine are optional. To see the magic under the hood, checkout the code in my [repo](https://github.com/AndrejPer/hidato-choco).
